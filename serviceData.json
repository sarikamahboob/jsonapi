        "description":"A relationship goes through numerous phases during its life cycle, and it is obvious for it to have a few rough patches. The strength of a relationship is reflected in how the couples deal with rough patches and move ahead. The lifestyle of the people and the modern day thinking has changed the pattern of thinking of people in respect to relationships. This has turned the statistics for divorce and marriage upside down. While divorce and separation is necessary in many cases, if the problems are not only circumstantial, but also irrecoverable and irreversible.We believe that love should be given a chance, and that there are relationships that can be saved, if only the people involved take that first step and make that last ditch effort to save their relationship. And, this is where the couple therapy comes in. Our approach towards couples therapy is oriented not only towards solving the problems the couple is facing with each other, but to revive the feeling of love and affection they have towards each other.",

        "description":"Depression is a mental illness, which one should not confuse with the short-term emotional distress, anxiety attacks or feeling low, which also are constituents of depression. Anyone can feel low for a brief period of time, or have anxiety attacks once in a while, but that does not mean they are suffering from depression. Depression is much more serious than that, and is a persistent feeling of sadness, loneliness, grief, uselessness, and emotional pain. If not treated at the right time, it can lead to a person turning suicidal, and may try to harm himself/herself or commit suicide.We approach patients with depression through various routes at one time to make the treatment effective, and help patients recover from their disruptive mental state sooner. First of all, we listen, understand, analyze and evaluate the problems of the patient through verbal counselling sessions, and then categorize the depression level medically to define the treatment path to follow. Depression is treatable, and there are many effective treatments available.",
